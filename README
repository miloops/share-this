ShareThis
=========

Simple plugin to share pages with most popular social sites.

At the moment, the following APIs are supported:
  - Facebook
  - Digg
  - MySpace
  - StumbleUpon
  - del.icio.us

Example
=======

The following will render in the view the links to share the current page with the defaults settings of ShareThis.

<%= share_this %>


self-explanatory example:
<%= share_this(:include => [:facebook, :digg], :discard_image => true,
               :url => article_path(article),
               :title => article.title) %>


Discarding the images is also possible:
<%= share_this(:discard_image => true) %>

TODO
====
- Improve documentation
- Remove document.title and javascript when getting the page title with Rails becomes possible.
- Add more APIs.
